# College-Football-Playoffs
This repository contains the final project for my Statistics Capstone (STATS 485), where I analyzed whether or not Florida State University (FSU) should have been included in the College Football Playoff (CFP). Using a combination of data visualization and the Bradley-Terry model for statistical analysis, this project explores the various factors that influence CFP selection and evaluates FSU's performance against these criteria.
